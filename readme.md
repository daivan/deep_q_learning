Create the conda environment
```
conda install pytorch cpuonly -c pytorch
```
This is needed for the atari games
```
pip install gym[atari]
```



# The new way
We are forced to use python 3.7 because pywin32 only supports 3.7 as far as I know.
```
conda create --name py37 python=3.7
```

```
pip install gym
```

```
pip install matplotlib
```

```
pip install torch
```

```
pip install torchvision
```


### Screen grab

```
pip install opencv-python
```

```
pip install pywin32
```
